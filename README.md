# Physics II
A little guide for stuff generally covered in Physics II.

## Notes

As part of this project of mine, i'm providing a PDF with notes and the LaTeX template used to make it. You can find them inside of the `notes` folder of this repo. 

The template that was used in this project was produced using the Legrand Orange Book template, available [here](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/the-legrand-orange-book).
Original author of the Legrand Orange Book template: Mathias Legrand (legrand.mathias@gmail.com) with modifications by: Vel (vel@latextemplates.com). Give them some love!

The original license for this template is [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 Deed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/), All restrictions apply as far as i'm concerned, no Lawyer, but better safe than sorry.

## Julia Scripts

Besides the notes, there are a few scripts, written in the Julia programming language, that you might found useful. These scripts will mostly correspond to graphs in the main notes, and can be accessed on their own if need be.

## Cool study materials!

As i write this, i'm a student, and i want to help other students, it just so happens i'm not the only person with such an idea, there are lots of places where you can find help, here's a few i know of:

- [Yale's Fundamentals of Physics II Course](https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-201/lecture-1)
  
### Also, here's a list of books that are really useful and your college probably has:

- [Sears And Zemansky's University Physics With Modern Physics: Technology Update](https://www.amazon.com/University-Physics-Modern-Technology-Update/dp/032189796X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YOH9C4SNB01H&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ECP-gWSEfoGfpYTLNRV0aeohKrrOiQZgUo5teVlU6Yixn2JlSo1SDsbxmWQ7_x6Ti6A2jsyumhmzhPX55Q8CtiL5a56lHC-o7ORX0pRsjGhEz8QgcBVNGkZVzse6rDbxLIeMpSOyP51QmW4o7yAJsafIkomVFDBeK_G6R_tzl1JPv4pK0nynpHKyQiuOeNTXWskix-2bhRtmWeM5M5PikpPgtoT8lhw7t04PJuAY5mc.iDNcBtB6hi5SvdIzDrbBdfYC_t-K_gzaKJJNNWLLjhk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Sears+%26+Zemansky%27s+University+Physics&qid=1705694187&s=books&sprefix=sears+%26+zemansky%27s+university+physics%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C151&sr=1-1)
